# go-ray-tracing

This is a Go implementation of the [awesome ray tracing tutorial](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

## Running

Go is so great that you can download all the dependencies for this project, build and run an application with just one command:

```
go run apps/megaScene/megaScene.go
```

Run this command from the project root and it will put the `megaScene.png` image there.
BEWARE: the mega scene is called so for a reason. With the current settings, it takes 2h30m to render on my laptop (2017 Macbook 12'').
If you want something to render faster, run

```
go run apps/threeSpheres/threeSpheres.go
```

You will get this image with 3 spheres (as promised!):

## Testing

Execute the following command from the project root to run the unit tests:

```
go test ./...
```

## Profiling

go get github.com/pkg/profile
Put `defer profile.Start(profile.ProfilePath(".")).Stop()` in main.
Run `go tool pprof cpu.prof`
Run `top` or `web`
